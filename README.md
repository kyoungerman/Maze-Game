---NOTE: This project is a work in progress. It will be updated regularly, with the final version being uploaded by May 18, 2019.---

This project was written as a group, in Java, using Eclipse, for COSC 3015: Software Design

The group consists of: Kevin Youngerman (myself), Brandon Donaghe, Addison Dugal, Jordan Fitzgerald, and Ryan Evans

This project is a game. The player has 16 maze pieces, and needs to put them in the center grid so that it reforms the maze correctly. Eventualy, the maze pieces will appear in random order with different rotations, but for now they are in order and unrotated. 

This project is private because making it public would essentially give my other classmates the answers to the assignment. So to avoid the possibility of accidentally committing academic dishonesty, it is private.
