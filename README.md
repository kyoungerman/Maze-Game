---NOTE: This project is an incomplete version of the Final Product. The final version has been lost, as I do not have access to the repository any more.---

This project was written as a group, in Java, using Eclipse, for COSC 3015: Software Design

The group consists of: Kevin Youngerman (myself), Brandon Donaghe, Addison Dugal, Jordan Fitzgerald, and Ryan Evans

This project is a game. The player has 16 maze pieces, and needs to put them in the center grid so that it reforms the maze correctly.

In the final version, the pieces were randomized. In this version, they are not.
